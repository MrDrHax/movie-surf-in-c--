## Introduction

## Execution example



## Why we took this approach



## Cases where there is an error

We found that if the CSV file is not correct, it will fail.

Other errors include OS errors, and permission errors (i.e. not enough privileges to read file) that land far from our scope.

Otherwise, it is a pretty resilient piece of code, correct error try and catch is handled, with care to explain what happened.

Vigorous tests have been done, including random inputs.

## Conclusions
